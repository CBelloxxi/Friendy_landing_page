      <p>Have a basic look into how our app helps you donate to the the homeless! <br> <br> <span> 1. Scan a Donees QR Code. <br> 2. Have a look at their profile, make sure it's them. <br> 3. Sign-up or Login to your account. <br> 4. Choose whether to Create an Assistance Report or Donate directly to that person. <br> 5. If donate, choose donation amount, if Assistance, set location via geo-tag. <br> 6. Go through payment processing. <br> 7. Go to your dashboard, find the donee you've donated to and check the amount to confirm payment complete. </span> <br> <br> Now you know how it works, it takes minutes if you've never used the app before and seconds if you have - see how simple it is, now you can genuinely help someone that genuinely needs it!</p>

      <p>We aim to enable modern finance for those who are deprived of the opportunity. This means that those who are not fortunate enough to have smartphone or a modern banking app, can still access modern finance via their unique QR code. The money that is donated to them can be accessesed at participating shops such as; Convenience, Petrol Stations, Charity etc. <br> <br> <span>By enabling modern finance, we open the doorway for the homeless to be able to save money and earn themselves rental deposits to get them off the streets for good! The two main features of Friendy are; Assistance Reports and Donations. On your personal dashboard you'll be able to see all those who you've helped. </span> <br> <br> By creating Assistance Reports, if a homeless person needs warm clothing, or shelter for that night, you can leave a report which will be displayed for all Friendy users to see and help. Your Donations History shows all the individual people you've donated to, the status of their funds and is a reminder to you, of those you've helped, you can set up recurring payments to that person too, if you want to continue supporting them on their way out of homelessness! </p>

      <p>Friendy was Founded by Christopher Bellocci, he had the idea to be able to help homeless via contactless donations back in 2019 while at University - he completed a was chosen out of hundreds of other students to participate in a Social Exchange Programme for Social Innovation - specifically focusing on homelessness. The seed for the idea was built from there!<br> <br> Currently it's just me, but I'm currently looking for Co-Founders, Advisors, Staff or just people that agree with the message, if you're one of them get in touch, I'd love to hear from you! <br> <br> <span><em>Let's change the world together. <br> -Chris.</em></span></p>

        <h2 id="FAQ">FAQ's</h2>
        <p>Here you'll find some detailed info about how we work!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-menu">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked>
          <i class="arrow"></i>
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> So how does it work?</h3>
          <p>We built an app that enables contactless donations to the homeless. Friendy users add homeless people to the app when they meet them (simple picture and small description), then are verified and a profile is created for them. Each profile has a uniquely generated QR code usable for that person only. The homeless person will carry a copy of this QR code for donors to scan (it's a small piece of paper which can be printed limitlessly and inexpensively). Once scanned you can leave geo-located assistance reports for attendance or donate directly to the person in need (or both). That person can then access those funds at participating shops such as corner shops and buy things they actually need, such as; toiletries, underwear and blankets etc. Finally they can begin to save towards rental deposits - to get them off the streets for good!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked>
          <i class="arrow"></i>
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> What safeguards do you have?</h3>
          <p>Look, understanding that the homeless are human beings means that we understand some have addiction problems. We also understand that is also a reason why a lot of people won't donate cash. We prohibit the use of the Friendy app to buy alcohol from participating stores, and of course drugs are not allowed unless prescribed by a physician at a pharmacist. Tobacco is a grey area, for the time being it is also prohibited too. So, rest assured, your money will go to something positive!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked>
          <i class="arrow"></i>
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-money-bill-transfer"></i> Where does the money go?</h3>
          <p>Every donation to an individual homeless person, goes directly to that homeless person - you can see who, where and when you donated in your personal dashboard. We don't take any of the money donated. We charge a 30% transaction fee on top of the donation amount so that we can function as a business and continue helping those in need. So, if you donate Â£10 to a homeless person, we'll add Â£3 on top. The total cost to you would be Â£13 (not so bad, in order to help keep Friendy going and donate to someone that needs it). There are no additional fees and the homeless person that wants to use or withdraw their money will not be charged as we think it's not right to charge those who really need that money to live. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked>
          <i class="arrow"></i>
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-tower-observation"></i> If I leave a report, will the person get in trouble?</h3>
          <p>No, the idea is that you can mark the report as an emergency or non-emergency. If it's an emergency for example, it's a winters night and they don't have any warm clothing, we'll work to get them that warm clothing immediately, the idea is for likeminded people that want to help, to get on the app, go to that person and give them what they need. If it's a non-emergency, for example they've unfortunately not been able to eat enough food that day, it will be marked on the map and the aim is for users to go out and bring them food, or direct them to the nearest soup kitchen etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" checked>
          <i class="arrow"></i>
          <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-simple"></i> Why should you trust us?</h3>
          <p> Our aim is simple, it's to facilitate contactless donations to the homeless in a modern world where everything is contactless. We believe is doing what's right, and as such helping our fellow humans at home when we can is important. You're only ever two months away from being homeless (that's what the stats say) so, if you were in the same situation, wouldn't you want to someone to help you too - or better yet an organisation that helps to facilitate what many people can't currently do? That's why Friendy exists, and is our sole aim, to help reduce homelessness as much as we can and make a physical difference in a world full of conflict.</p>
